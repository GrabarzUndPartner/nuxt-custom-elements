## Builder

Nuxt 3 supports the following builders:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

This is controlled by the Nuxt option `builder`.
If builder `@nuxt/webpack-builder` is set, the custom elements will also be a webpack build.

::: code-group

```js[nuxt.config]
  builder: '@nuxt/webpack-builder',
```

:::

## Entry File

It is recommended to set the entry file with the file extension `.ce.vue`.

With `.ce.vue` in Dev-Mode the component can be used as CustomElement.

::: warning
If no `.ce.vue` is set, the CSS of the component is missing in dev mode.
