## Breaking Changes

### Plugin

Plugin has been removed.

To register entries during runtime, the composable [`useCustomElement`](/v2/guide/composable/usecustomelements) is now used.

**Plugin implementation:**

```vue
<script>
export default {
  created () {
    this.$customElements.registerEntry('example');
  }
}
</script>
```

**Composable implementation:**

```vue
<script setup>
import { useCustomElements } from '#imports';
const { registerEntry } = useCustomElements();
registerEntry('example');
</script>
```

## Builder

Nuxt 3 supports the following builders:

- `Vite`
- `Webpack`

This is controlled by the Nuxt option `builder`.
If builder `@nuxt/webpack-builder` is set, the custom elements will also be a webpack build.

```js[nuxt.config]
  builder: '@nuxt/webpack-builder',
```

## Beware of `.ce.vue.`

It is not recommended to use the file extension `.ce.vue`.  
With this setting the components are used as CustomElement during runtime (Dev/Server) and incorrect views may occur.
